# TACOMBI COMBI — LOCKED BUILD SPECIFICATION  (rev 7)
**Status: AUTHORITATIVE.** Nothing in the build may contradict this file.
Change this file *first*, log it, then change code. `verify.py` asserts the
machine-checkable rows on every build.

**Working method (standing):** ground in the reference → build → *adversarial*
audit against the reference → iterate. Never build before grounding; never
call it done off self-review.

## 0. Evidence grades used in this file

| Grade | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **M** | **Measured by me** from `ref_source.jpeg` — pixel sampling or radial/column profile. Reproducible; method recorded in §8. |
| **S** | **Sourced** — Tacombi's own published text, or a factory/marque reference. URL in §8. |
| **R** | **Research-agent visual read** of higher-resolution photographs **that I could not fetch and view myself**. Treat as strong but unconfirmed. |
| **E** | **Expert inference** — not observed, derived from what a correct 1963 T1 must be. |
| **U** | Unresolved. |

The primary user photograph is **246 × 197 px**. That is a thumbnail. It can
settle large-scale colour, aperture count and wheel construction; it cannot
settle small hardware. Rows below are graded accordingly and **must not be
silently upgraded**.

## 0.1 Subject — grounded

The **Playa del Carmen combi**: a **1963 Volkswagen Type 2 (T1)**, bought in
Mexico City in 2006, driven through the Yucatán and converted into a taco
stand. **This is the Playa bus, NOT the Nolita one** — see §7.

**S** — Tacombi's own account: *"We purchased a 1963 'combi' bus in Mexico
City, wheeled it slowly (very slowly) through the Yucatan peninsula and parked
it comfortably in … Playa del Carmen. The engine was scrapped, transmission
sold, seats swapped for cooking equipment, and the roof was reeled back to
produce a taco serving stand."*

**S** — Founder Dario Wolos: the bus was **green** when bought, cost **$3,000**,
was **"missing three of its windows"** and **"only had the front bench"**; he
*"figured out how to **cut open** the Tacombi"*. Opened 6 February 2006.

**E** — "Missing three of its windows" is almost certainly *why* the show side
became three serving hatches: the donor bus already had no glass there.

## 0.2 Retired readings — regressions if they reappear

Rows marked ⚠ were **locked incorrectly in rev 3** and corrected in rev 4.

- open-bed single-cab pickup with drop-sides, corner posts or a canopy
- gold side script — it is **silver**
- "Estilo Tacombi" — it reads **"Señor Tacombi"**
- plain font capital T — it is an **ornate swash**
- VW roundel upside down — **V above W**, always
- glazed side windows where there should be **open serving hatches**
- ⚠ **whitewall tyres** — the white annulus is the **cream-painted steel rim**;
  the tyres are **blackwall** (**M**, §8.1)
- ⚠ **chrome bumpers** — they are **painted cream** (**M**, §8.2)
- ⚠ **VW nose roundel painted cream** — it is painted **red on the cream nose**
  (**M**, §8.3)
- ⚠ **a fourth side bay, glazed/frosted, carrying "100% CALIDAD"** — there are
  **three apertures only**, then **solid cream sheet metal** at the rear
  corner. The decal sits **on that sheet metal** (**M**, §8.4)
- ⚠ **folding canvas ragtop** — the roof is **cut into rigid hinged steel
  lids** (**S** + **R**)
- ⚠ **timber plank counter** — the counter is a **cream-painted slab** (**M**, §8.5)
- ⚠ **amber bullet indicators** — bullet pods ended **Aug 1961**; a 1963 has
  flat oval **"fish-eye"** lenses (**S**)
- ⚠ **bus lowered 65 mm / 110 mm** — **unsupported by any evidence**. Stock ride height
- ⚠ **clean restoration gloss** — the subject is **weathered**; see §3.9
- chrome hubcaps — they are **red domes with a light VW**

## 1. Body configuration — FROZEN

**S/E** — The donor is an **11-window Kombi/Microbus**: split windscreen, two
cab door glasses, **three side windows per side**, one rear window, **no roof
skylights, no curved rear corner glass** (those are Deluxe/Samba only, and the
corner glass was deleted from Aug 1963 anyway).

| Item | Value | Grade |
|---|---|---|
| Body | T1 **Kombi**, full height nose to tail | **M** |
| Roof | **cut into rigid hinged steel lids**, modelled **CLOSED**; fore-aft seam and a second smaller lid visible | **S**+**R** |
| Side, show side (+Y) | cab door glazing, then the **THREE stock side windows with the glass removed** — open serving hatches. Aft of the third: **solid cream sheet metal** carrying the "100% Calidad" decal | **M** |
| Counter | **cantilevered cream-painted slab counter** under the three hatches, chamfered front end, running past the tail | **M** |
| Side, off side (−Y) | twin outward-hinged cargo doors + three glazed windows in the same bay positions | **E** (never photographed) |
| Cab door | front-hinged; vent wing + main drop glass; **"ice-pick" pull-lever handle** (push-buttons are Dec 1963+) | **S** |
| Rear | **small** hatch + small window (the big hatch is MY1964), engine lid below, cream rear bumper | **S** |
| Interior | **galley** — counter, plancha, shelving. Not passenger seats | **S** |

### 1.1 Serving-bay layout (show side, x in metres) — **THREE bays only**
| Bay | Front edge | Rear edge | Treatment |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **+0.820** | **+0.313** | open serving hatch |
| 2 | **+0.195** | **−0.321** | open serving hatch |
| 3 | **−0.435** | **−0.960** | open serving hatch |
| — | **−0.960** | **−2.007** | **SOLID sheet metal**, 1.046 m wide. "100% Calidad" sunburst + pink star applied here |

Measured from `ref_side.jpg` (§8.6). Widths 0.507 / 0.516 / 0.526 — they are
**not** identical; they grow slightly toward the tail. rev-3's "three evenly
sized, evenly spaced" was an approximation.

Band: sill **z = 1.402**, head **z = 1.798**, corner radius 0.055, pillars 0.11.
**Bay 4 is deleted.** Any object named `glass_bay3_*` or a fourth aperture
cutter is a regression.

## 2. True-to-scale hard points — FROZEN

Frame: **+X forward, +Y left, +Z up, ground Z = 0**, metres.
All values **S** (1963 factory brochure) unless noted.

| Dimension | Value | Was (rev 3) |
|---|---|---|
| Overall length, factory configuration | **4.280 ± 0.06** — front overhang 0.849 + wheelbase 2.400 + rear overhang 0.809 + bumper standoffs | 4.280 |
| Overall length **as it stands today** | **4.06 ± 0.04** — the rear bumper has been removed, see §2.4 | — |
| Overall width | **1.750** | 1.720 |
| Overall height, unladen | **1.941** | 1.940 |
| Wheelbase | **2.400** (front +1.300, rear −1.100) | same |
| Track front / rear | **1.369 / 1.359** | 1.375 / 1.360 |
| Tyre — **NOT 6.40-15** | dia **0.665 ± 0.015** (R 0.3325), section ≈0.129. Tyre/flange ratio measures **1.512 ± 0.02** in `ref_side` and 1.43–1.49 in `ref_workshop`, against 1.64–1.68 for a 6.40-15. Implied fitment ≈ **215/60R16**. rev 4 "corrected" this to the factory 0.683 and was wrong — rev 3's 0.665 was right | 6.40-15 / 0.683 |
| Rim — **16 inch, not 15** | flange OD **0.4396** (R 0.2198), PCD 5×205. Wheelbase/flange measures **5.46 ± 0.08**; a 15" rim requires 5.77 (4σ away), a 16" gives 5.44. Ellipse axis ratio 0.984 rules out perspective. A 1963 left the factory on 15" — **these are not the original wheels** | R 0.1905 (15") |
| Hubcap | dia **0.280**, depth ≈ 0.080 | — |
| Body max half-width | **0.875** | 0.860 |
| **Ride height** | **LOWERED.** Rear arch-to-tyre gap **41 mm** (rev 5 said 71; corrected in the verification pass) against a stock 90–120. Front bumper top 0.348 against a stock ≈0.47. Donald's original rev-3.1 reading was right; rev 4 wrongly zeroed it on absence-of-evidence from a thumbnail. **Set `RIDE_DROP = 0.065` and `ARCH_R = TIRE_R + 0.041`** | rev4 said stock — WRONG |
| **Stance rake** | body sits **nose-down ~1.7°** relative to the axle line (72 mm over the wheelbase). Every height falls ≈28 mm per metre forward. Not modelled yet | — |
| Roof edge / crown | 1.8935 / +0.032 | same |
| Belt line (two-tone break) | ~~z = 1.386~~ **superseded by §10** | same |
| Front / rear sheet metal | x = +2.108 / −2.108. **Note §10.7: the tail measures −2.007 on the vehicle and the factory overhang gives −2.009, so the model is ~99 mm long at the tail. Unresolved.** | same |
| Bumper faces | x = ±2.145 | ±2.140 |
| Bumper centreline | **stock height, z ≈ 0.480** — *not* straddling the wheel centre | "low" |

Tolerance **±25 mm** on L/W/H. **The front end has been flagged as wrong
before — front dimensions and front hardware get checked explicitly every
iteration.**

### 2.1 Belt/sill conflict — RESOLVED against the side elevation
rev 4 flagged a 16 mm sill-to-belt gap where the factory drawing implies ≈90 mm.
Measured on `ref_side.jpg`: **window sill 1.307, body two-tone break 1.207** —
the break sits **100 mm below the sill**. The build's 16 mm is out by ~6×.
**Action: lower Z_BELT to sill − 0.100.**

Note the trap that caused the original misreading: on the serving flank the
visible cream/red edge is **the counter fascia bottom at 1.082**, not the paint
break. The true break is only visible **forward of the counter, on the cab
door**. Do not measure it aft of x ≈ +0.9.

### 2.4 Rear bumper — REMOVED on the real vehicle
`ref_workshop.jpg` shows a cream rear bumper with tubular over-riders fitted at
the conversion stage. Neither in-service photo has one: the tail apron rolls
under to a lip, with only a 14×24 px chrome bracket stub left. It is **not**
hidden behind the counter — the counter fascia bottom is at 1.08 m and a bumper
would sit at 0.35–0.48 m. **Model it absent.** Rear overhang is factory at
0.809 ± 0.02.

### 2.5 Settled by the verification pass
- **Front indicator: fish-eye / teardrop, correct for a 1963.** Fitted lamp
  measures 71 mm base × 78 mm protrusion, ratio 1.05; a bullet pod is ≈45 mm
  base at ratio ≈2. It only *reads* as a bullet in side elevation. Workshop
  aperture is a round 74 ± 6 mm hole.
- **VW nose roundel is RED in the red livery.** Emblem strokes measure
  R/G = 1.590 against a cream nose at 1.047, with no neutral specular anywhere;
  the workshop chrome reads R/G = 0.974.
- **Counter overhang past the factory bumper line: 0.10 m** (rev 5 said 0.31).

### 2.2 Contested measurements — ALL THREE NOW RESOLVED (kept for the record)
A measurement pass on the high-res photos returned three extraordinary claims.
Each is plausible but would overturn a factory dimension, so each needs
independent re-derivation before it enters the build:
- **RESOLVED — CONFIRMED, but the number was wrong.** Tyres are NOT 6.40-15, but the OD is 0.665 not 0.606; the prior 128 px came from the ground/shadow line, not the tyre edge. The rims are 16". Original: Wheelbase-derived scale (211.2 px/m) and
  tyre-derived scale (187.4 px/m) disagree by 12.7 %, which resolves if the
  tyre OD is ≈0.606 rather than 0.683. Corroborated by a tyre/rim ratio of
  1.39–1.47 measured on the bare rims in `ref_workshop.jpg` against 1.69 stock.
- **RESOLVED — CONFIRMED.** See §2.4. Original: Not visible in either in-service photo. Conflicts with a
  cream rear bumper reported in `ref_workshop.jpg`. It may have been removed
  when the counter wrap was fitted.
- **RESOLVED — REFUTED.** The body is NOT shortened; the scale was right (211.5 ± 1.3 px/m) and 4.06 m is the *current* length with the rear bumper removed. Factory configuration is 4.28. Original: This would mean a shortened body, which
  is a very large claim. More likely the front hub centre — the lower-confidence
  of the two, being occluded by the leaning man — is misplaced. **Re-derive the
  scale from an unoccluded feature before accepting.**

### 2.3 Confirmed additions
- A **rear serving opening** exists in the tail, and the **counter wraps the
  tail** with a 0.313 m overhang and ≈0.30 m outboard projection.
- Overall height measures **1.960** with the lids closed — *above* stock 1.93
  despite the lowering, implying the roof-lid frame stands proud by 0.10–0.15.
- Front indicator aperture in `ref_workshop.jpg` is a plain **round ≈75 mm
  hole**. Lens type remains **U** — neither bullet base nor fish-eye oval
  confirmed.

## 4. Detail inventory — must all be present

**Stock 1963 T1 (S/E):** roof peak vent over the windscreen · two bottom-pivot
wipers · **10 rear-quarter air-intake louvres per side** (10th added March
1963) · **fuel filler flap on the RIGHT rear quarter, immediately aft of the
louvres** · small rear hatch + small window · oval tail lamps · rear number
plate on the engine lid with lamp above · engine lid T-handle · drip rail full
length · ice-pick cab handles · driver's-side mirror · bumper overriders.

**Tacombi-specific (R — unverified by me, model but flag):** white bobble /
ball-fringe trim round each serving aperture · printed menu cards on the
pillars between apertures · string of small bulbs along the drip rail · brass
edge strip on the counter lip · radiused counter tail overhanging the body ·
chrome number-plate surround on the engine lid reading **"1963"**, empty ·
underside of the raised roof lid painted with flowers and menu strips
(only visible if the lid is ever modelled open).

## 5. Mesh & texture quality bar

- Watertight, manifold body shell. No floating or intersecting artifacts.
- Crisp, regular quad topology on the shell; no n-gon pinching on the nose.
- Sharp colour boundaries (procedural, resolution-independent).
- Decals 3K-4K, **non-overlapping**, correctly oriented, correct handedness.

## 6. Render — FROZEN

Cycles CPU + OpenImageDenoise. White seamless studio, shadow-catcher
composited to **pure white** with a soft contact shadow. Large soft sources
only. Interior fill required so the serving hatches read as depth, not holes.
**Hero stills, not turntables.** Final ≥ **2400 × 1600**.

Deliverables: 3/4 front-left hero (reference angle), 3/4 rear-left, 3/4
front-right, ortho side / front / rear, nose detail, low 3/4.

---

## 7. Do not mix references

Tacombi has used more than one bus. The **Nolita / New York** bus has **no
folk art**, **no side script**, **glazed** apertures with gold frames and
hand-painted menu names, a **chalkboard** roof board, a narrow shelf counter,
and "251 ELIZABETH STREET / NUEVA YORK" on the rear corner. **Any photograph
showing those features is the wrong bus.** Whether it is physically the same
vehicle is **U**.

---

## 8. Measurement provenance (reproducible)

**8.1 Blackwall + cream rim, not whitewall.** Radial colour profile about the
front hub at px (114.5, 160.5), clean sector 185–265°: r 0–7 px strongly red
(sat 0.70–0.83) = hubcap; r 7–10 px luminance **rises** to 169 while
saturation **falls** to 0.27 = pale annulus; r 12–17 px dark (lum 34–93, sat
< 0.08) = tyre. **There is no dark rubber between the hubcap and the pale
annulus.** A whitewall requires black sidewall inboard of the white band.
Therefore the pale annulus is the painted rim.

**8.2 Cream bumper.** Bumper blade (193, 175, 169) sat 0.13 vs roof cream
(206, 208, 200) sat 0.04 and rear panel cream (189, 176, 171) sat 0.10 —
same family. Chrome in open sun would split into a bright sky band and a dark
ground band, not a flat mid-tone.

**8.3 Red roundel.** Ring arc (155, 114, 105) sat 0.32; interior/strokes
(177, 115, 107) sat 0.40 — a 60-unit R-over-G bias. Cream nose is sat 0.01;
clean red is sat 0.82. A neutral shadow would hold R ≈ G ≈ B. The roundel is a
faded red.

**8.4 Three apertures, then sheet metal.** Column luminance minima in the
window band: cab window lum 131.5, then dark openings at px x 137–158,
163–180, 185–202, then a **bright** region x 205–228 at lum 178–204 matching
cream, carrying a pink/red decal blob. Bay darkness 61.6 / 71.6 / 106.4 vs the
cab window's 131.5 supports open apertures over glass.

**8.5 Painted counter, not timber.** Counter top (212, 208, 197) **sat 0.07**;
fascia (187, 179, 170) sat 0.09. Natural timber sits at sat 0.25–0.45 with a
strong R > G > B ramp.

## Change log

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-08 | Initial lock. Body corrected from single-cab pickup to Kombi van. |
| 2026-08-08 | Script text corrected to "Señor Tacombi"; capital T must be an ornate swash. |
| 2026-08-08 | Script colour corrected to **silver**. |
| 2026-08-08 | rev 3.2 — modified-bus details locked: whitewall tyres, red domed hubcaps with white VW, low bumpers, proud bullet indicators. |
| 2026-08-08 | rev 3.1 — bus is **lowered**: body dropped 65 mm relative to the wheels. |
| 2026-08-08 | rev 3 — grounded against prior project context. |
| 2026-08-08 | **rev 4 — evidence audit.** Added evidence grades (§0) and measurement provenance (§8). **Corrected against measurement:** whitewall → blackwall + cream rim; chrome → cream bumpers; cream → **red** VW roundel; four bays → **three** + solid rear panel; canvas ragtop → **cut steel lids**; timber → **painted** counter; bullet → **fish-eye** indicators; lowered → **stock** ride height. **Corrected against factory sources:** L 4.280 → 4.290, W 1.720 → 1.750, tyre 5.60-15 → **6.40-15** (dia 0.665 → 0.683), track → 1.369/1.359. Finish changed to **weathered** by user decision. Added §4 detail inventory, §7 wrong-bus warning, §2.1 unresolved belt/sill conflict. Guards extended to 10. |

| 2026-08-08 | **rev 5 — high-resolution photographs supplied by Donald.** Three large photos (workshop/green, side elevation, rear 3/4) supersede the 246x197 thumbnail as primary reference. **Ride height LOWERED reinstated — rev 4 was wrong to zero it; Donald's original reading was correct.** Belt/sill conflict resolved: break sits 100 mm below the sill, not 16. Aperture positions re-measured and are not evenly sized. Rear serving opening and counter tail-wrap added. Three contested measurements quarantined in §2.2 pending independent re-derivation. Full working in REF_MEASUREMENTS.md. |

| 2026-08-08 | **rev 6 — verification pass on the three quarantined claims.** All three resolved by independent methods. Body NOT shortened (factory 4.28 stands; 4.06 is today's length minus the removed rear bumper). Rear bumper genuinely absent in service — model it off. **Tyres are not 6.40-15: OD 0.665 and the rims are 16 inch, not 15** — rev 4's "correction" to the factory 0.683 was wrong and rev 3's 0.665 was right. Rear arch gap corrected 71 → **41 mm**. Indicator settled as fish-eye (period-correct). Roundel settled as RED. Counter overhang corrected 0.31 → 0.10 m. |

## 10. rev 7 — the canonical constants (supersedes any value above)

Everything in this section was re-derived from the high-resolution photographs
by an adversarial skeptic pass over the 13 critical findings in
`AUDIT_RECOVERED.md`, and then implemented and verified against the built mesh.
`STATE.md` is regenerated from the live geometry by `audit.py` on every run; if
this table and `STATE.md` disagree, **`STATE.md` is right and the build has
drifted**.

### 10.1 The three frames — get this wrong and everything moves 65 mm

| what | frame | why |
|---|---|---|
| `t1_shell` / `t1_core` / `t1_detail` constants, all outlines | **UN-DROPPED** | `build.py` step 8b subtracts `RIDE_DROP = 0.065` from every vertex last |
| `t1_mats` shader constants (`Z_BELT`, `V_APEX`, `V_RISE`) | **DROPPED = above ground** | a shader reads `Geometry→Position` off the already-dropped mesh at render time |
| `verify.py` | runs **AFTER** the drop | its own header denied this until rev 7; probing a 5.5 mm shut line in the wrong frame read 26 % open instead of 100 % |

Proved by measurement, not assumed: the painted break lands at z = 1.3859
against `Z_BELT` = 1.3860, and the window band reads 1.3070/1.7100 above ground
against `Z_SILL`/`Z_HEAD` = 1.372/1.775 un-dropped.

### 10.2 Two-tone break and nose V-swage — LOCKED

| constant | value | frame | was | error |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Z_SILL` | **1.372** | un-dropped (1.307 AG) | 1.4020 | +27 mm |
| `Z_HEAD` | **1.775** | un-dropped (1.710 AG) | 1.7980 | +25 mm |
| `Z_BELT` | **1.207** | above ground | 1.3860 | **+111 mm** |
| `V_APEX` | **0.340** | above ground | 0.8720 | **+476 mm** |
| `V_RISE` | **0.867** | = `Z_BELT − V_APEX` | 0.5140 | — |
| `V_POW` | **0.60** | — | 1.16 | profile is concave, not convex |

`V_APEX ≤ 0.396 un-dropped` is a **hard bound, not an estimate**: the cream
wedge is still 14 px wide where the bumper occludes it in `ref_workshop.jpg`,
and the bumper top measures 0.331 ± 0.020 AG. Independent of any px/m scale.

The audit's proposed replacements — belt 1.240 and apex 0.620 — are **both
wrong** (32 mm low and 224 mm high respectively) and both rest on a **Samba**
blueprint or the retired 246×197 thumbnail. See `SKEPTIC_PASS.md`.

**Do not derive the belt from `sill − 100 mm` using the model's own sill.**
That is a restatement of two measurements, not a physical law; feeding the
model's sill into it launders the sill's own error into the belt. Set each from
its own measurement and let the 100 mm fall out as a *check*.

Mirror `V_APEX`/`V_RISE`/`V_POW` into `t1_shell.nose_shape.zV` whenever they
change, or the pressed swage and the painted break de-register. Verified: they
register to **0.0 mm**.

### 10.3 Livery colour — rev-3 shipped a retired reading

| | linear albedo | = sRGB | hue | sat |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `RED` **locked** | **(0.5520, 0.1441, 0.0176)** | (196, 106, 36) | 26.3° | 0.816 |
| `RED` rev-3 shipped | (0.5250, 0.0395, 0.0072) | (192, 56, 20) | 12.5° | 0.894 |
| `CREAM` **locked** | **(0.6172, 0.6308, 0.5776)** | (206, 208, 200) | 75.0° | 0.038 |
| `CREAM` rev-3 shipped | (0.7900, 0.7700, 0.7150) | (230, 227, 220) | 44.2° | 0.043 |

rev-3's `RED` had its **green channel 3.6× too low**, making it a **deep
crimson** — which §0.2 retires *by name* ("**Not** a deep crimson"). The
retired reading survived in code for four revisions because nobody converted
§3's own measured sRGB back to linear. rev-3's `CREAM` also had R > G where the
measurement has G > R.

**Folk art is a graded bouquet, not wallpaper.** The density mask ran at the
tile's own alpha in its dense regions, covering the red almost completely and
dragging the measured flank from sat 0.816 to **0.27**. Locked: opacity ceiling
`W_ART = 0.30`.

### 10.4 Weathering — measured targets, not adjectives

| target | value | source |
|---|---|---|
| cream local luminance variation @ 25 / 100 / 400 mm | 4.22 / 7.26 / 10.54 % RMS | `ref_side.jpg` |
| dust tide line | knee **h = 0.40 ± 0.04 m**, full ≤ 0.30, zero by 0.48 | CIELAB `C*/(L*+16)` |
| flank above 0.40 m | **clean** — chroma ratio flat to ±7 % up to 0.92 m | same |
| upward-facing dirt | ΔL\* −8.8, ΔC\* +5.0, Δhue −6.6° toward ochre | `ref_rear34.jpg` |
| edge-wear Pointiness window | **0.520 → 0.600** (flat flank reads 0.500–0.503) | emission bake |

The intuitive `smoothstep(0.75 → 0.25)` dust ramp is **~3× too tall** and would
dust a band the reference shows clean. Sun fade is a **design value, not a
measurement** — neither in-service photograph is in direct sun, so fade cannot
be separated from exposure. **No subsurface scattering anywhere**; nothing on
this vehicle is translucent.

### 10.5 Geometry added or corrected in rev 7

| item | locked value (un-dropped unless noted) |
|---|---|
| serving aperture edges | (+0.820, +0.313) (+0.195, −0.321) (−0.435, −0.960); widths 0.507 / 0.516 / 0.525 — **not** three equal 0.600s |
| louvres | 10 per side, x −1.285 → −1.670, pitch 21.1 mm, top slot 1.085, bottom 0.895, built horizontal |
| counter | X0 +0.918, X1 **−2.423**, Z 1.147–1.254, thickness 0.107, Y_out 1.166, tail wrap quarter-arc R 0.150, front chamfer 45° × 0.05 |
| cab-door gap bottom run | **z ≥ 0.780** — must clear the front arch top at 0.771 |
| script decal | X +0.784 → −0.494, Z 0.445 → 0.918; `senor.png` recropped to its ink bbox (AR 2.702) |
| VW roundel | ring ⌀0.370, centre 1.130 AG |
| wipers | translated ≥ +0.025 m along `WS_N`; blade built in the windscreen plane; pivot axis on the cowl normal |

### 10.6 Guards — strengthened, never removed

The rollback guard's `after < before * 0.6` could not detect anything short of
total destruction: worst legitimate ratio is **0.9902** (SUB=1) / **0.9862**
(SUB=2), so a cutter could delete 39 % of the shell and pass. A **no-op**
boolean passed silently. The obvious digest **does not work** — EXACT
re-tessellates n-gons even on a true no-op (Δf = +9, spurious ΔVolume
−3.38e−06 m³); **vertex-count equality is the only clean count test.**

Locked: cutter volume ≥ 1e−4 m³ and bbox-overlap pre-checks; vertex and face
ratios ≥ 0.95; Δv ≠ 0; non-manifold / loose-vert / zero-area must not increase
(zero-area threshold 1e−12 m², because a cutter plane coincident with a subsurf
edge loop legitimately emits 5–20 µm slivers); per-kind sign tests. Validated
against all 44 measured (cutter, level) rows: **2 true positives, 0 false
positives.** Four negative controls fire that the old guard passed.

Positive assertions added: each expected aperture and shut line must actually
exist; `calidad_L`'s material must have Transmission Weight 0; Subsurface
Weight must be 0 scene-wide; **no detail object may be invisible from every
hero camera** (both wipers shipped buried in the nose skin for six revisions).

**The `≥ 20 mm clear of roll-over` rule is REFUTED and replaced.** Causal test:
skip the wheel-arch cutters and the identical door-gap cutter at the identical
z succeeds at SUB=2. The real rule: *a panel-gap outline must not cross the lip
of another aperture, and where it runs near a roll the outer-skin slope
relative to the cutter's extrusion axis must stay below `t_skin / gap_width`*
(0.51 at 2.8 / 5.5 mm).

### 10.7 Known open defects — logged, not fixed

| defect | measured | note |
|---|---|---|
| **overall height 89 mm short** | model **1.871**, `REF_MEASUREMENTS` §2.3 measures **1.960** with the lids closed | the roof-lid frame stands proud by 0.10–0.15 m and is not modelled. This is why the vehicle reads flat and stretched. |
| **tail 99 mm long** | model −2.108, measured −2.007, factory arithmetic −2.009 | fixing it is a loft change; the counter's X1 was set to preserve the *measured* 0.316 m overhang relative to the model's own tail |
| nose-down rake ~1.7° | not modelled | `Z_BELT` becomes a line, not a constant, when it is |
| script ink placement | implemented from the measured ink bbox | the panel-vs-ink distinction cost a 2.2× size error once |

### 10.8 Camera and lighting — LOCKED

Full-frame **36 mm sensor**, real focal lengths, **f/8** on the heroes and
f/6.3 on the detail views, focused on the **near front arch**. Measured on
`hero34f`: 78 mm, f/8, focus 10.12 m, **sharp 7.25 – 16.71 m**, hyperfocal
25.4 m. Ortho views carry no DoF.

Lighting is **one long raking strip** (16.0 × 0.55 m, spread narrowed to 78°)
plus support, not six neutral rectangles — a long narrow source draws a single
unbroken highlight along the shoulder that pinches where the panel turns, which
is the read that says sheet metal. The whole rig was **2.6 EV hot**: cream
measured 233–240 against 206 and AgX desaturates as it approaches white, which
is what dragged the flank to sat 0.27. Rig energies scaled **×0.165**; the
numbers in `studio.py` are now the numbers that render.

Compositor, in the order a real camera imposes them: bloom on the *linear*
render before the white composite (after it, a linear-21.0 backdrop flares the
frame), then chromatic aberration, vignette and grain on the projected image.
Pixel filter widened to 1.50 px. Every stage is switchable from the
environment; `T1_FX=0` disables the chain.

---

| 2026-08-09 | **rev 7 — adversarial skeptic pass, then implementation.** 0 of the 13 criticals killed, 11 corrected; acting on the audit's numbers as written would have introduced fresh errors in six places. **SUB=2 passed for the first time** — both cab-door gap booleans had been collapsing the shell 205562 → 12 v and rolling back, so every hero render this project ever made was of a bus with no cab-door shut line. Belt, V-swage, window band, aperture edges, louvres, counter, script and roundel all set from measurement. `RED` corrected from a **retired deep crimson**; folk art capped from wallpaper to a graded bouquet. Weathering node group built to measured targets. Boolean guard strengthened and validated (2 true positives, 0 false positives); the `≥ 20 mm roll-over` rule refuted and replaced. Physical camera with real DoF; one raking strip replaces the six-rectangle rig; rig found 2.6 EV hot. `audit.py` now emits **`STATE.md`** from live geometry — it had printed a hardcoded, fabricated belt line for six revisions. Open defects logged in §10.7 rather than quietly carried. |
